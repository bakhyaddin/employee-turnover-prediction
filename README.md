**This project is group project participating Gokşin Kocakaya, Bahyeddin Nuri, Mehmet Ali Topçuoğlu**\
\
There are two main perpectives in the project
1. For the first part the model uses data of all employees who were hired before 1 January 2019 and predicts whether they’ll leave the firm within 12 months of their hire. Employees’ demographic and job specific features are used.

2. For the second part which was to predict who will leave the company in one year time from now, a new dataset was formed:
   - a. Excluding employees who left the firm before 1 January 2018
   - b. Excluding employees who were hired after 1 January 2018
